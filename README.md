This project is a simple CSS-based layout that creates a right-angle corner pattern using `div` elements and absolute positioning.

## 🔧 Features

- Built using only HTML and CSS
- Uses `position: absolute` to place lines precisely
- Blue background with clean white corner lines
- Recreates a geometric L-shaped or corner-like pattern

## 💡 Purpose

The goal of this project was to practice precise alignment using CSS. It helped me understand how to control element size, spacing, and positioning using only code — no images or external libraries.

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – main HTML structure
- `style.css` (if separated) – contains the pattern layout and style rules

## 🚀 How to Use

Just open the `index.html` file in any browser to see the pattern.

You can also copy the CSS into your own project to reuse the pattern as a design element or background.

## 📚 Learning

This pattern helped me learn:

- CSS `position: absolute`
- `top`, `left`, `width`, `height` usage
- Layout design using basic shapes
